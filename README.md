# Description

Enemy Alerter is a small mod for Jupiter Hell that shows an Alert about number of visible enemies and spawns a modal alert to prevent movement when a lot of enemies are encountered. Mostly useful on a SteamDeck where the enemies even with outlines can be missed.

Many thanks to <https://github.com/cpiod/JH-JoviSec-PDA> for the Map and action log, that is fully integrated to use only a single trait slot from the player.
